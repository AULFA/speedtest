Network capability testing

![speedtest](./speedtest.jpg?raw=true)

## Usage

1. Unzip `speedtest-***.zip` to your desktop or other writable medium
2. Double-click `run.bat`
3. Wait for the tests to complete
4. Email the contents of the `logs` directory to LFA. Please let us
   know where you were when you executed the tests. Knowing the country,
   locale, whether you were on 3G or on hotel WiFi, etc, is all useful
   data.

## Troubleshooting

#### Powershell is not installed

You need [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell)
installed if running these tests on Windows. See the link for details.

#### One or more tests failed

It may be possible that you're on a network that has such poor connectivity
that it can't complete one or more tests. Don't despair; send us the log files
anyway! Failures are still useful data.
